# Poll-IO

Poll IO is an application created using React Native which allows the user to log in and anwser polls. 

This project was created for a University Module and the criteria was an application in which the user could answer a poll which was created by a admin user.
The Admin uses a web based dashboard, in which they can create and look at the polls. This was part of a group project in which I was left in charge of creating the mobile application. 

I have not uploaded the admin dashboard as this was developed by other members of the group but can be found here (https://gitlab.com/post-symposium/boardroom-voting-app.git). 

I didn't take a heavy role with the web applicaiton as I have a experience with React native and React and the team didn't want me to soley develop both the platforms and I thought it best to delegate the developement of the web application to thouse who haven't had the chance to develop there web based skills, once split up into a web application team they decided to go with Angular. 

A Backend is required to run the project as well. I soley developed this in express.js which is a Javascript backend framework. I used this framework as I have a confident amount of experience in Javascript to be able to pick the framework quickly due to it's excellent documentation. This can be found here (https://github.com/TheAdamRogers/Poll-io-Backend).
